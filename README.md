# 42 Berlin (2023.5 ~ )

## ***< Description >*** <br>
In the curriculum, I mainly worked with C and C++, learning data structures, algorithms, and OS. Since each assignment only provided a set of keywords, I was expected to study independently and figure things out on my own, which helped me develop the habit of learning without being limited by specific tools or methods. The projects were too challenging to complete alone, so managing my time well and staying connected with peers was essential to gather useful information. Rather than fearing failure or focusing on competition, I learned how to collaborate closely with my peers.

## ***< Project description >***
### Piscine
Month-long intensive program that introduces the fundamentals of programming using C.<br>
Daily coding exercises and peer evaluations under strict deadlines.<br>
The curriculum focuses on memory management, pointers, and Unix-based workflows.

### Libft
Create my own C library by cloning representative functions of the library.<br>
Learn data types, pointers, and memory management by creating functions<br>
that handle memory such as memcpy, calloc, .. and string-related functions<br>
such as strcpy, substr, and split.

### ft_printf
Reimplement the printf function, handling flags, precision,<br>
and specifiers like (cspdiuxX)% using variable arguments.

### get_next_line
Create a function that reads one line at a time from a FD (File Descriptor)<br>
based on the '\n'(newline) or EOF. Learn about file input / output system calls<br>
such as read and write, and static variables.

### Born2beroot

### pipex
Recreate the behavior of Unix pipes by chaining commands using pipe() and execve().<br>
It simulates < file1 cmd1 | cmd2 > file2 by creating child processes.<br>
Learn abbout FD, process creation, and redirection.<br>
low-level system call: pipe(), fork(), dup2(), execve().

### push_swap
Sort a stack of numbers using only a few specific operations like push, swap, and rotate.<br>
The challenge is to keep the number of moves as low as possible.<br>
